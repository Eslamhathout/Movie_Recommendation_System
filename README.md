# Movie_Recommendation_System

Intro:

“What movie should I watch this evening?” Have you ever had to answer this question at least once when you come home from work? As for me: yes, and more than once. From Netflix to Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important given the huge demand for personalized content of modern consumers.

An example of a recommendation system is such as this:
User A watches Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.
User B does search on Game of Thrones, then the system suggests Breaking Bad from data collected about user A.
Recommendation systems are used not only for movies but on multiple other products and services like Amazon (Books, Items), Pandora/Spotify (Music), Google (News, Search), YouTube (Videos), etc.

I decided to build a full Django website based on the idea of the movie recommendation systems. The website itself is not included in the scope of the project, but the movie recommendation system itself will be the intended scope in the capstone.
